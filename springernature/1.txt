The effect of film thickness on texture was investigated, and it is clear that the (100) texture gradually increases and the (111) texture decreases with increasing film thickness. A Pt_ x Pb intermetallic metastable phase was observed by X-ray diffraction, and it is found that the position of this peak shifted from 38.30° 2θ ( d : 0.2348 nm) to 37.10° 2θ ( d : 0.4213 nm) with increasing firing temperature from 350°C to 550°C. The (111) preferred orientation in the PZT film was promoted by the metastable Pt_ x Pb phase. The formation of the (100) texture of perovskite phase in the multilayer films was mainly attributed to the effects of both substrates and crystal growth rates which depend on the crystal orientation.
Structural changes stimulated by ultraviolet (UV) laser irradiations of sol-gel derived inorganic oxide films were investigated. Dried gel films of TiO_2, Nb_2O_5, Ta_2O_5, SrTiO_3 and Pb(Zr_ x Ti_1− x )O_3 (PZT) were found to be crystallized by the laser irradiation. On the other hand, the photo-induced change in gel films of BaTiO_3, LiNbO_3 and LiTaO_3 was not observed although the laser beams were absorbed in the films. These sol-gel films were thermally crystallized at almost the same temperature around 600–700°C except TiO_2. Thus, the UV-laser-induced crystallization is not directly ascribed to a simple thermal effect with the irradiation. Photochemical properties of the cations are assumed to be important for the change in sol-gel films.
Kinetics of non-isothermal precipitate process and crystal growth of perovskite (CaO·TiO_2) phase in CaO-TiO_2-SiO_2-Al_2O_3-MgO system were studied. The experimental results show that the relative volume fraction can be described by the equation given by Matusita et al. and the experiential expression of average crystal radius was obtained. The particle coarsening in non-isothermal process has important effects on the crystal growth of perovskite phase.
Nanosized LaCoO_3 cobaltite oxide powder with perovskite structure was successfully synthesized at a relatively low calcination temperature using an amorphous heteronuclear complex, LaCo(DTPA)·6H_2O, as a precursor. The precursor decomposed completely into cobaltite oxide above 400 °C according to the DTA and TGA results. XPS revealed that the decomposed species was composed of LaCoO_3 cobaltite oxide after the precursor was calcined at 500 °C for 2 hours. XRD demonstrated that nanosized LaCoO_3 crystalline powder with perovskite structure was formed after the calcination temperature increased to 600 °C. The grain size and the crystal size of LaCoO_3 increased with the calcination temperature from 500 °C to 800 °C, and the heat-treatment time has a less obvious effect on the grain size and the crystal size. It is a useful way to synthesize nanosized perovskite oxides using an amorphous complex as a precursor. This method can be easily quantitatively controlled.
La_0.8Sr_0.2CoO_3 (LSCO) oxide powder was prepared using the adsorption properties of cellulose. The preparation process was studied by XRD, FTIR, TG-DTA and CO_2-TPD techniques. The results of XRD, IR and TG-DTA testified that cellulose could successfully reserve the homogeneity of the solution system to the solid precursor. During the early stage of pyrolysis, cellulose was partially oxidized, and some COO^− groups appeared in its texture, which were then complexed with the adsorbed metal ions, and effectively suppressed the aggregation of metal ions. Formation of a pure perovskite and the properties of the powder resulted were found to be significantly influenced by the cellulose to metal nitrate ratio. Also the properties of the resulting powder were greatly influenced by the calcination conditions. If the produced carbon dioxide could not be eluted in time, carbonate would be formed in the bulk. Hence, a high calcination temperature (>800°C) was needed to acquire a pure phase LSCO. At optimized conditions, nano-crystal LSCO could be obtained at as low as 500°C.
Starting with the history of the fundamental science of the relation of structure to composition delineated completely by Goldschmidt, we use the perovskite structure to illustrate the enormous power of crystal chemistry-based intelligent synthesis in creating new materials. The perovskite structure is shown to be the single most versatile ceramic host. By appropriate changes in composition one can modify the most significant electroceramic dielectric (BaTiO_3 and its relatives) phase in industry, into metallic conductors, superconductors or the highest pressure phases in the earth. After an historical introduction of the science, detailed treatment of the applications is confined to the most recent research on novel uses in piezoelectric, ferroelectric and related applications.
Uniform crystals of ZnWO_4 have been synthesised from the equimolar mixtures of ZnO and WO_3 by conventional solid state method. For the first time the sample has been characterised detailedly to confirm the formation of pure single phase of perovskite ZnWO_4. The formation of ZnWO_4 has been confirmed by sintering the mixtures of ZnO and WO_3 at two different temperatures one at 900 °C and other at 1000 °C. It is observed that the sample sintered at 1000 °C for 24 h shows complete formation of the single phase of ZnWO_4. The crystallinity and the phase formation has been confirmed by X-ray diffraction technique. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements have been carried out for the bulk ZnWO_4 sintered at 1000 °C for 24 h, showing 16% of Zn, 16% of W and 68% of O indicating stoichiometric ZnWO_4. Surface morphology studies by scanning electron microscopy showed uniform crystals of ZnWO_4. The purity of the compound has also been checked in depth by Energy Dispersive X-ray method indicating the absence of foreign ions apart from that, the ratio of Zn : W has been calculated and found to be 1 : 1 confirming the stoichiometric ZnWO_4 inside the crystals.
The nature of the B-site cation ordering and the associated defect process necessary to stabilize the ordered domains were investigated using the WO_3-doped Ba〈Mg_1/3Ta_2/3〉O_3 〈BMT〉 system as a typical example of Ba〈B′_1/3B″_2/3〉O_3-type complex perovskites. It was shown that only the 1 : 2 long-range ordering of the B-site cation existed in both undoped and WO_3-doped BMT perovskites. The atomic defect mechanism associated with the stoichiometric 1 : 2 long-range ordering was systematically investigated. It is concluded that the substitution of W^6+ for Ta^5+ in the WO_3-doped BMT enhances the degree of the 1 : 2 long-range ordering and produces the positively charged W _Ta ^⋅ sites with a concomitant generation of tantalum vacancies 〈V_Ta″″′〉 and mobile oxygen vacancies 〈V^⋅⋅ _O〉 for the ionic charge compensation.
Stabilization of a perovskite structure was attempted by replacing Mg for Zn in Pb(Zn_1/3Ta_2/3)O_3. System powders were prepared using a B-site precursor method by reacting PbO with separately-prepared precursor compositions. Effects of the substituent Mg concentration on perovskite phase developments and subsequent changes in dielectric properties were investigated, as a function of measurement frequency. Phase transition modes reflected in the dielectric constant spectra were analyzed in terms of diffuseness exponent and degree of diffuseness. Internal microstructures of the ceramics were examined, and correlations with perovskite phase contents and dielectric properties are discussed.
La_(0.57−2 x /3)Sr_ x Li_0.3TiO_3 perovskites were synthesised using a conventional solid-state reaction. Large Sr^2+ ions partially substituting for La^3+ ions were found to disturb the cubic perovskite structure and cause the superstructure lines to gradually decrease in the x-ray diffraction patterns and almost disappear when x = 0.12. On the contrast, there still exist superstructure diffraction spots in the electron diffraction pattern on microdomain when x = 0.12. The lithium ion conductivities of the compounds were improved in the range of 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.08, which does not obey the principle of the carrier concentration. An expansion of the unit cell and the disordering of La^3+ (Sr^2+), Li^+ ions and vacancies in A sites could be a mechanism for the enhancement of the conductivity with Sr^2+ doping.
Transmission Electron Microscopy has been conducted on rhombohedral perovskite oxides with composition LaCoO_3, La_0.8Sr_0.2CoO_3, and La_0.8Ca_0.2CoO_3. Thin foils prepared within the first weeks of sintering showed macroscopic strain and a very high defect density, which included fault-related superlattice structures. Samples prepared several months after sintering, showed no significant macroscopic strain and the main defect was found to be domains due to reflection twinning in the pseudo-cube plane. The behaviour is likely to be related to accomodation of spontaneous strain arising upon cooling of the material from the sintering temperature. The presence of twin domains illustrates the lowering of lattice symmetry as compared to the ideal cubic perovskite structure, and is relevant for explaining recent observations of ferroelastic behaviour of these materials.
Porous composite cathode coatings containing (La_0.8 Sr_0.2)_0.98MnO_3 (LSM) and ZrO_2-12% Y_2O_3 (YSZ) were prepared by vacuum plasma spraying (VPS) and flame spraying (FS) on prefabricated substrate-based planar solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) with 60 mm in diameter. Microstructural observations reveal the open porosity of the cathode coatings and prove qualitatively the compositional gradient from YSZ-LSM composite to pure LSM. The electrochemical behavior was investigated by impedance spectroscopy. The results of graded cathodes compared with nongradient and bilayered ones are discussed with respect to the cathodic polarization resistance between 750 and 950°C. Bilayered cathodes indicate the lowest cathodic losses followed by the graded ones and the conventional composite. Flame spraying as a rarely used processing tool for SOFC components can provide cathodes of high electrochemical performance.
Dense and fine micro-structured lead zirconate titanate (PZT) fibers were successfully fabricated by sol-gel process from lead acetate dehydrate, zirconium normal butoxide, and titanium isopropoxide. An addition of perovskite seed particles (2 wt%) can lower the formation temperature of the perovskite phase and a single-phase perovskite PZT fiber can be obtained by heat-treating the precursor fiber at 500°C. Crystallization of perovskite phase was improved with the seed content. The diffraction peaks of (200) and (002) in the PZT fiber with 6 wt% seed was better split than in the PZT fiber without seed, which indicates that the tetragonality of PZT fiber was increased by adding seed particles. Seed particles also affected microstructure development of the PZT fibers.
A novel preparation route to the perovskite materials Ca_0.3La_0.7CrO_3, Sr_0.16La_0.84CrO_3, and Sr_0.2La_0.8MnO_3 is described. The method produces the phase pure perovskite phases after calcination at 700°C for 2 hours. The powders produced are unagglomerated, and consist of hollow spherical particles 0.15 μm in diameter. EDX has shown that the careful control of reaction conditions is vital to control the phase composition, and that small changes in stoichiometry result in the production of unsinterable powder.
Thin films of the non-stoichiometric perovskite SrFeO_2.5+x have been grown by the pulsed excimer laser deposition technique onto sapphire substrates. The electrical conductance properties of the thin films have been determined in a series of experiments done both isothermally and with programmed temperature changes from ambient to 490°C and under O_2/N_2 atmospheres with oxygen concentrations in the range from 100 ppm to 100%. Over these ranges of temperature and oxygen partial pressure a wide range of oxygen stoichiometry in SrFeO_2.5+x occurs (approximately 0 < x < 0.5), which includes all four known phases in the SrFeO_2.5 + x + O_2 system. The experimentally measured values for the activation energy of conduction, ε_A, for SrFeO_2.5+x films at temperatures 100 < T < 200°C are in the range 0.30 < ε_A < 0.47 eV under oxygen at partial pressures 0.001 <P(_O _2)< 0.05 atm and 0.18 < ε_A < 0.28 eV for 0.2 <P(_O _2)< 1 atm. These values for ε_A are typical for compositions of SrFeO_2.5+x with stoichiometries in the range 0.25 < x < 0.45. For T < 300°C and for P(_O _2)< 0.001 atm the films were essentially insulators. For T > 250^°C and P(_O _2)> 0.001 atm, the oxygen stoichiometries of the films change during the programmed temperature ramps. For these conditions, the values δε_A/δ T exhibit minima/maxima in the temperature range 250 < T < 320^°C which are interpreted as being due to the onset of the order-disorder phase transition from the cubic to the tetragonal and orthorhombic ordered phases of SrFeO_2.5+x with oxygen stoichiometry in the range 0.08 < x < 0.38. The SrFeO_2.5+x thin films have application as oxygen sensing materials, and a relationship between conductance and oxygen sensitivity, S_ ox , has been derived. The values of S_ ox for SrFeO_2.5+x thin films increases by more than an order of magnitude for compositions close to the lower stoichiometric limit where the principal phase conversion is between the cubic perovskite and the brownmillerite forms.
Conductive LaNiO_3 thin film electrodes were deposited by chemical solution deposition (CSD) from nitrate solutions onto polycrystalline Al_2O_3 and (Ba,Ca)TiO_3 PTCR ceramic substrates. The electrical properties of the LaNiO_3 thin film on Al_2O_3 and of the interface consisting of LaNiO_3 and the semiconductive oxide ceramic were investigated. The deposited LaNiO_3 films were about 250 nm thick and consisted of nanosized particles. The resistivity of the LaNiO_3 film was about 3 × 10^-3Ωcm at 20°C. The PTCR ceramic consisted of μm sized particles and exhibited an electronic resistivity of about 10 Ωcm at 20°C and a steep increase of the resistivity of a few orders of magnitude above the Curie point at about 120°C. The electrical properties of the LaNiO_3/PTCR interface were dominated by the properties of a barrier layer between the PTCR ceramic and the LaNiO_3 electrode. The potential dependence of the impedance indicated that the barrier layer consisted of a depletion layer within the PTCR ceramic, when the flat band potential of LaNiO_3 on the PTCR ceramic at about −250 mV was exceeded. Additionally the formation of an insulating layer at the LaNiO_3 electrode has to be taken into account.
The stability of the lead scandium niobate (PSN) and itssolid solution with lead titanate (PSNT), both with the perovskitestructure, was investigated in a platinum capsule under hydrothermalconditions. The perovskite solid solution of PSNT decomposes in waterat 640°C, which results in the transformation to thetetragonal structure after the treatment. In KOH solutions, the PSNTpowder was partially dissolved, it results in the precipitation ofPb_2ScNbO_6 powders with the perovskite structure, and thegrowth of both lead oxide (massicot) and K_4Ti_3O_8needle crystals at the top of the capsule. In contrast, singlecrystals of both PSNT or PSN were grown in KF solutions at the top ofthe capsule by hydrothermal treatments at 600°C with atemperature gradient of 40°C. In both cases a deficiency ofthe scandium content achieves the stabilization of the pyrochlorestructure of the grown crystals.
We have investigated the initial stage nucleation and growth of epitaxial SrRuO_3 thin films grown on both polished (as received) and buffered HF (BHF) etched single crystal (0 0 1) SrTiO_3 substrates by 90° off-axis sputtering. Atomic force microscopy indicates a dramatic difference in the initial stage growth of SrRuO_3 films on the two substrates. The films on polished substrates nucleate as rectangular islands, which merge together to form a continuous film as the thickness increases. Complete coverage is obtained at film thickness of ∼20 nm. In contrast, the film on BHF etched substrate nucleates as finger-shaped islands at the step sites and continues to grow by adatom diffusion to the step sites. Complete coverage is obtained at a film thickness of ∼10 nm. This difference in the initial stage nucleation is attributed to the difference in surface morphology and termination layer of the two substrates. However, the thicker films on both as received and BHF etched substrates have identical surface morphologies. Such studies on the initial stage nucleation will also help us understanding the growth kinetics and development of surface morphology and interfaces in multilayered perovskite thin film heterostructures and devices.
New interesting results in the crystal structure of the perovskite βLa_0.33NbO_3 were revealed using selected area electron diffraction, powder X-ray diffraction techniques and Rietveld refinement method. Although the superstructure of βLa_0.33NbO_3 could not be seen by conventional X-ray powder diffraction technique, the electron diffraction patterns revealed weak spots resulting in a superstructure array for the atoms of βLa_0.33NbO_3. The crystal symmetry is compatible with an orthorhombic cell, space group C mmm . From Rietveld refinement, the resulting lattice parameters are: a = 7.82(1) Å, b = 7.83(9) Å, c = 7.90(9) Å and goodness of fit R = 0.1107, Rwp = 0.15. The superstructure is built from distorted octahedra NbO_6 along the [001] axis. Results suggest that this distortion may be produced by occupation of La atoms in (2a) and (4l) sites.
Biomaterials, in particular those used for orthopaedic prostheses, consist of a metallic substrate, exhibiting excellent mechanical properties, coated with a ceramic layer, which guarantees resistance to the corrosion and an elevated bioactivity. In this paper the preparation of sol-gel films of hydroxyapatite, HA (Ca_10(PO_4)_6(OH)_2), on titanium substrate is described. The samples were obtained through the dip-coating method, starting from a colloidal suspension of hydroxyapatite. In order to increase the adhesion between the HA film and the metallic substrate, the same substrate has been preliminarily coated either with titanium oxide, TiO_2 (in the anatase or rutile phase), or calcium titanate, CaTiO_3 (perovskite). Also these latter films have been deposited from a sol-gel solution. The characterization of the films through XRD, SEM, and AFM gave good results for the crystallinity of the deposited HA; for what concerns the sample morphology, the films turned out to be homogeneous and crack-free.
A field effect transistor device (FET), consisting of a nonlinear Mott Insulator channel material, and a high dielectric-constant gate oxide, is explored as a nanoscale device. Experimental functionality of a large scale prototype (5 μm channel length) has been demonstrated. The underlying physics of the device is analyzed and modeled using a time-dependent Hartree approach. Timing estimates suggest a relatively short switching time.
The ground-state ferroelectric distortion of PbTiO_3 thin films is studied using a first-principles effective Hamiltonian to describe the structural energetics at a microscopic level. Under short-circuit electrical and zero-stress mechanical boundary conditions, (0 0 1) films as thin as one unit cell are found to support a stable perpendicular polarization. Size effects in the layer-by-layer ferroelectric distortion are discussed. The continuum limit of the first-principles effective Hamiltonian has the same form as the widely-used Landau-Ginzburg expression for the free energy near T_c, so that the present results can be directly related to those of previous phenomenological studies. In particular, a microscopic interpretation of the extrapolation length δ is proposed.
Ferroelectric and leakage current characteristics of the MOD-derived SrBi_2xTa_2O_9 (0.8 ≤ x ≤ 1.6) and SrBi_2.4(Ta_1-yNb_y)_2 O_9 (0 ≤ y ≤ 1) thin films were investigated. The SBT and SBTN films were fully crystallized to Bi-layered perovskite structure by annealing at 800°C for 1 hour in oxygen atmosphere. The ferroelectric characteristics of the SBT films were optimized at the Bi/Ta mole ratio x of 1.2. The leakage current density of the Bi-excess SBT films decreased remarkably by the post-metallization annealing at 800°C for 10 minutes in oxygen ambient. The ferroelectric characteristics of the SBTN films were optimized with the SBN content y of 0.25. The SrBi_2.4(Ta_0.75Nb_0.25)_2 O_9 film exhibited 2P_r and E_c of 19.04 μC/cm^2 and 24.94 kV/cm at ±5 V, which were superior to 2P_r of 11.3 μC/cm^2 and E_c of 39.6 kV/cm obtained for the SrBi_2.4Ta_2O_9 film after the post-metallization annealing. The MOD-derived SrBi_2.4(Ta_0.75Nb_0.25)_2O_9 film did not exhibit the polarization fatigue after 10^11 switching cycles at ±5 V.
The possible use of electrically conductive perovskites SrRuO_3, La(Ni_0.6Co_0.4)O_3 and (La_0.5Ca_0.5)FeO_3 as electrodes for PLZT ((Pb,La)(Ti,Zr)O_3 solid solutions) thick films was evaluated. As the ceramic electrode is placed between an alumina substrate and a PLZT thick film layer possible interactions between Al_2O_3 on one side and PLZT on the other and the chosen perovkites were studied. Both SrRuO_3 and LaNi_0.6Co_0.4O_3 reacted at 1000°C with Al_2O_3 forming SrAl_2O_4 and RuO_2 in the first case and LaAlO_3 and La_2NiO_4 in the second case. At higher firing temperatures reactions between La_0.5Ca_0.5FeO_3 and Al_2O_3 resulted in small quantities of an unknown phase or phases. The results of reactions of all three perovskites with PLZT were perovskite solid solutions incorporating ions from the conducting perovskites into the PLZT structure.
A relaxor ferroelectric material, Pb(Mg_1/3Nb_2/3)O_3(PMN) with perovskite phase was prepared by one-step calcination in the present study. The PMN powder with >99% perovskite phase was prepared successfully by adding an aqueous Mg(NO_3)_2 solution rather than MgO to the alcoholic slurry of PbO and Nb_2O_5, followed by calcination at 950°C for 2 h. The DSC and XRD analysis showed that the pathway in the one-step calcination was different from those of the known columbite or solution processes. The PMN powder sintered to 95.6% of the theoretical density at even 900°C for 2 h. Its room temperature dielectric constant showed 13800 at 1 kHz, the loss of dielectric constant of 0.05% and the specific resistivity of 2.4 × 10^10 Ω·cm.
Phase-pure perovskite powders in the Pb(Fe_2/3W_1/3)O_3-Pb(Mg_1/3Nb_2/3)O_3 system were synthesized by a B-site precursor method and were densified into ceramic form. Lattice parameter changes were examined as a function of composition. Sinterability was studied by measuring bulk densities of the fired ceramic specimen. Composition- and frequency-dependent weak-field dielectric properties in the low frequency range are reported. Curie temperatures shifted linearly with composition change, while the maximum dielectric constants did not show a linear relationship.

Sol-gel processed PLZT thin films were fabricated on ITO-coated glass substrates with RTA (rapid thermal annealing). The electrical and optical properties such as hysteresis curves, dielectric constant, dielectric loss and optical transmittance of thin films were investigated. The PLZT thin films were crystallized to the perovskite structure by RTA at 750°C for 5 min. As the La percentage was increased, the dielectric constant increased, and that of 9/65/35 PLZT thin film was 1750. The coercive field and remnant polarization decreased with La increase from 33.82 kV/cm to 14.71 kV/cm and from 39.26 μC/cm^2 to 9.57 μC/cm^2 respectively. As the Zr percentage increased at 2% La, the coercive field decreased from 52.94 kV/cm to 30 kV/cm, but the remnant polarization increased from 22.74 μC/cm^2 to 50.75 μC/cm^2, and the dielectric constant had a maximum value of 1269 at 2/55/45 composition. The optical transmittance was increased as La percentage increased but was decreased as the annealing temperature increased.
The Sr_1-xCe_xMnO_1-α system (0≤ x ≤ 0.5) was investigated with respect to its structural, thermal and electrical properties. Although un-doped SrMnO_3 has the perovskite structure above 1400°C, the structure is unstable at room temperature. However, partial substitution of Ce for Sr in SrMnO_3 stabilizes the perovskite structure down to room temperature. Single phase perovskite is obtained for 0.1≤ x ≤ 0.3 in Sr_1-xCe_xMnO_1-α, and it remains stable even following heat treatment at 800°C for 100 h. The dependence of the electrical conductivity on temperature was measured from room temperature to 1000°C in air. Ce doping dramatically enhanced the electrical conductivity of SrMnO_3. Sr_0.7Ce_0.3MnO_1-α exhibits a higher conductivity (290 S · cm^-1 at 1000°C) than that of La_0.8Sr_0.2MnO_3 (LSM, about 175 S · cm^-1) and remains n-type over the whole range of temperature examined. The thermal expansion coefficients in the system were nearly constant with values ranging between 1.24 × 10^-6 and 1.01 × 10^-6 cm/cm · K for temperatures of 50°C to 1000°C.

(Fe $$Pb[(Fe_{2/3} W_{1/3} )_{0.8 - x} (Mg_{1/3} Nb_{2/3} )_{0.2} (Fe_{1/2} Nb_{1/2} )_x ]O_3 $$ system perovskite powders (phase purity >99%) were prepared via B-site precursor routes. Lattice parameter changes were analyzed in terms of B-site cation stoichiometries and sizes. Weak-field radio-frequency dielectric characteristics were investigated to verify the effect of composition modification on Curie temperatures and maximum dielectric constants. Unusual relaxation behaviors of frequency dispersion in the dielectric constant spectra at paraelectric region were observed.
Crystal structure and dielectric property of tungsten-bronze type microwave dielectric ceramics, i.e., BaOLa_2O_34TiO_2 and Ba_6-3x (Nd, M)d_8+2x Ti_18O_54 (M = Y, Bi and x = 0.5, 0.7), are analysed. The optimum properties obtained in Ba(Nd_1-xBi_x)_2O_34TiO_2 were ε_r = 89–92, Qf = 5855–6091 GHz, and τ_f = −7–+7 ppm/°C x = 0.04–0.08. The Y-substitution in BaO(Nd_1-xY_x)_2O_34TiO_2 reduces the dielectric constant ε_r. Both the Y and Bi substitutions make τ_εr positive. The relative dielectric constant ε_r and temperature coefficient τ_εr are 109.5 and −180 ppm/°C in BaOLa_2O_34TiO_2, 76 and +40 ppm/°C in BaO(Nd_0.77Y_0.23)_2O_34TiO_2, respectively. The crystal structures were refined by Rietveld method using x-ray and neutron diffraction data. The most reliable results were obtained by refining the cation positions using the x-ray data and the oxygens from the neutron with a superlattice structure model Pnam(c-axis ≈ 7.6 Å). The refined structures show that the a/c ratios are related to the apical oxygen displacements of the Ti–O octahedra. The substitution of the small radius atom, Y, produced a structure of severely tilted and distorted Ti–O octahedra and large a/c ratio, while the large radius atom, La, small a/c ratio. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis showed heat anomaly indicating suspected phase transition in these materials. The relation between τ_εr and octahedron tilting in tungsten-bronze type material is discussed in relation with complex perovskite structure.
A model for the electrical conductivity in acceptor-doped oxides which involves an association between the acceptor-dopants and oxygen vacancies resulting in donor centers is considered. The model relates the behavior of the electrical conductivity with the temperature, ambient atmosphere and band structure. The predictions of the model are compared to experimental data for ZrO_2:16% Y and SrCeO_3:5% Yb oxygen conductors and some band structure parameters have been determined.
The compositional profile, distribution of the phases and the ordering behavior in the interdiffusion layer of the PNN/PZT functionally gradient piezoelectric ceramics have been investigated by electron probe microbeam analyses (EPMA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) respectively. The results show that the thickness of the interdiffusion layers (d) for Ni^2+, Nb^5+, Ti^4+ and Zr^4+ ions are ordered as d_Ni ^2+ > d_Nb ^5+ > d_Ti ^4+ > d_Zr ^4+. It is demonstrated by TEM observation and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns that a clear interface between the rhombohedral and pseudocubic phases exists in the interdiffusion layer. The SAED studies also reveal the presence of F spots along the [111] direction of the perovskite cubic unit cell. The origin of this superstructure is determined.
Perovskite phase formation and dielectric characteristics of $$Pb(Fe_{2/3} W_{1/3} )O_3 - Pb(Fe_{1/2} Nb_{1/2} )O_3$$ ceramic system with addition of $$Pb(Fe_{1/2} Ta_{1/2} )O_3$$ were investigated in order to examine the influence of $$Pb(Fe_{1/2} Ta_{1/2} )O_3$$ . The ceramic system powders were synthesized via a B-site precursor route. Peculiar behaviors of frequency dispersion in dielectric constant spectra in the paraelectric region were observed due to increasing conductivity. Lattice parameters, dielectric maximum temperatures, and maximum dielectric constants increased with increasing $$Pb(Fe_{1/2} Nb_{1/2} )O_3$$ content.
A single-step process for the preparation of nanoparticles of Ba_2LaZrO_5.5 is reported in this paper. The process is a modification of the combustion method, which resulted in Ba_2LaZrO_5.5 phase without a calcination step. This complex perovskite ceramic oxide thus obtained is characterized by high-resolution transmission-electron microscopy, X-ray and electron diffraction, thermal analysis, FT-IR spectroscopy, surface area measurements, and particle-size analysis. The particle size of Ba_2LaZrO_5.5 was in the range 10–70 nm and were of regular shape with well-defined grain boundaries.
A fluorine-oxygen substitution has been realized in a PZT material with a composition Pb_0.89(Ba, Sr)_0.11(Zr_0.52Ti_0.48)O_3 thanks to the introduction of Mg^2+ ions in the B-site of the perovskite. Oxygen vacancies may exist in the anionic sublattice if the fluorine rate is lower than the required one for a stoichiometric PZT-type ABO_3. The F–O substitution makes the relative amount of rhombohedral phase in the MgO and F-doped PZT samples decrease and a drastic increase of the Curie temperature is observed. Minimum values of dielectric constant, high level dielectric losses and piezoelectric coefficient are obtained for a fluorine concentration close to the stoichoimetric PZT one.
